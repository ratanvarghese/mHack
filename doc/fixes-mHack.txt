Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------


General New Features
--------------------
Added wands skill, which can be #enhanced for more powerful wand effects.
	Certain monsters have high effective wand skill as well.
	This is not as comprehensive as the wands balance patch in other variants.
	The main focus is to make the early game easier, not to make the late game
	more difficult.
Added Merchant role.
	Merchants are always looking for markets to buy supplies and sell
	their wares. They start with precious gems and expensive pieces of jewelry.
	Merchants are always neutral, and can be either human or gnomish.
	The special spell for merchants is wizard lock.
	On the Merchant Quest, Pasion tasks the player with fighting Sostratus
	for the Crown of Midas, a neutral dunce cap.
Added the Crown of Midas
	When worn, The Crown of Midas grants hunger, petrification resistance, and
	the golden touch.
	A player (or monster!) who fights bare-handed with the golden touch can
	turn enemies into gold statues, subject to petrification resistance just
	like stoning by cockatrice. Enemies are also subject to a petrifying
	passive attack, as if they were attacking a cockatrice. Weapons that hit
	a player or monster with the golden touch will turn to gold. Golems without
	petrification resistance will turn into gold golems instead of stone golems.
	Players with the golden touch also turn items to gold when applying, wearing,
	throwing, eating, unlocking, locking, picking up, looting, removing (from a
	container), quaffing or wielding the item. Some items, including most weapons,
	can change their material to gold as part of the object materials system.
	Other items, including most food, will turn into gold pieces. Artifacts and
	the corpses of petrification-resistant monsters will not turn to gold.
	Many items had to be added to the object materials system to implement the
	Crown of Midas including heavy balls, conical hats and statues.
	The Crown of Midas is intended to be hazardous to careless players, but
	rewarding to those who can work around the various problems. It also makes
	the Merchant quest somewhat dangerous, since Sostratus is likely to wear
	the Crown and use it against the player.
Added bribery skill, which can be #enhanced for cheaper bribes.
	Bribery is expensive, but effective against most humanoid monsters.
	The formula is 'B + ((B * M * M)/C)', where B is 1000 or less (depending on
	the bribery skill), M is the monster level, and C is charisma.
	Merchants start at basic in bribery, and can reach expert.
	Rogues, Tourists and Priests can also enhance the skill. Other roles are
	restricted, meaning they pay the full price for bribes.
